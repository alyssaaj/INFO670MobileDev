## Design and Purpose:
This is a quiz flashcard application. The users can add new flashcards and then quiz themself. It is a study tool. The primary audience for this application is people looking to review information.

## Basic Use
Using the bottom navigation bar, the user can select either the quiz page or the edit page. On the quiz page, the user is asked if they would like to start the quiz. If they start the quiz, their flashcards will load with the question shown and the answer hidden. The user can reload the quiz at any point to make all the answers hidden again or to update the quiz with new flashcards. On the edit page, the user is able add new flashcards (question/answer pairs). Blank questions or answers are not accepted.
