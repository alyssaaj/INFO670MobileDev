## Design and Purpose:
This is a budgeting/expenses tracking application. The users can set a budget then add new expenses. They can add categories for their expenses. The app displays how much money is currently left in their budget as well to keep them on track to their goals. The primary audience for this application is those looking to track their expenses to live within a budget without feeling shamed if they fail. The project uses a React Native frontend, PHP APIs, and MySQL database.
