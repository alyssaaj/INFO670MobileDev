## Design and Purpose:
This is a photo gallery application. The users can view a gallery of photos, select photos to expand, and edit their user profile. The primary audience for this application is photographers.


## Basic Use
Using the bottom navigation bar, the user can select either the gallery page or profile page. On the gallery page, the user can see all the photos in the gallery along with their titles and captions. If the user clicks on a photo, the photo will expand to show the full image as well as the photo's title and caption. There is a back button that returns the user to the gallery page. The user can also go to the profile page where they are able to add information to their user profile and save to a local database for their next use.


## Application Screenshots

When the user opens the app, it shows the Gallery screen.

Once a picture is pressed on the Gallery screen, the app takes the user to another page that expands the picture into the full image.

Using the bottom navigation bar, the user can navigate to the Profile screen. On the Profile screen, the user can adjust their profile. Clicking the Save button saves the profile to local storage allowing users to reload the app and maintain their profile settings.
